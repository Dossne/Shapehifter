# Art Style Guide (Non-Pixel Art)

## Style Master Prompt
Create clean, non-pixel-art 2D sprites for a top-down puzzle game. Use a cohesive, friendly illustrative style with soft shading, subtle highlights, and readable silhouettes. Keep the camera perspective straight-down (orthographic), avoid heavy outlines, and keep backgrounds transparent. Colors should be slightly stylized but still readable against neutral gray floors. Sprites should feel like they belong to the same world (materials, lighting direction, and scale consistent). Avoid photorealism, avoid pixel art, and avoid heavy texture noise.
